# Step 1: Setting up the Vue App with CodeSandbox

Create an new sandbox Vue project. Go to CodeSandbox and click on the “Create Sandbox” box. The options for which kind of sandbox you want to have appears. Here you choose Vue as basis for your sandbox. The instant IDE will when setup a base Vue project for you.

As far the IDE finished the setup, it open your project in the editor.
At the left you see all generated files in the navigation bar  and dependencies the project has so far. Don’t worry about the dependencies. We are going to explain it more later on.
Beside the navigation bar is the editor. Here you code and you can see all your changes in the preview on the right side, instantly.

As you can see the project boilerplate contains content so far. It contains a lot of references provided by Vue.js itself to get help.

The `main.js` is the entrypoint for the application start.

```javascript
new Vue({
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount("#app");
````

Here you can see that a Vue project is initialized and a Vue instance is generated by invoking the Vue constructor, `new Vue({/* options go here */})` and with `$mount([elementOrSelector])` the Vue instance is mounted to the `#app` element.

Every Vue application, no matter how big or small, starts with the root Vue instance.

- https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html.

In the first lines of the `main.js` you can find some imports. The first imports the Vue module and the second actually is our very first component we use, it is the App component.

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";
```

The App.vue actually contains the ID-Selector #app which we used to mount with the Vue application.

```javascript
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <img width="25%" src="./assets/logo.png">
    <HelloWorld msg="Hello Vue in CodeSandbox!" />
  </div>
</template>

```
