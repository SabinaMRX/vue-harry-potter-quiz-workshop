# Workshop: Harry Potter Movie Quiz

In this workshop we are building a little Harry Potter Movie Quiz (https://55ygd.csb.app/).
You will learn basics about Vue components, how data binding is done in Vue and how to perform simple REST API calls using Axios.

The workshop idea is inspired by [Dmytro Barylo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmytrobarylo/) from Ukraine who made the [Harry Potter Movie Quiz](https://madewithvuejs.com/harry-potter-movies-quiz). We would like to take this opportunity to thank Dmytro Barylo for the great idea on which basis we actually developed this workshop.


## Code Sandbox

For the workshop you will need your laptop. For developing the quiz we are going to use the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) which is a great instant IDE and prototyping tool for rapid web development.
It gives us the benefit to concentrate of learning Vue.js and not spending too much time into setting up a Vue.js project locally on the laptop. Thatâ€™s one thing we are going to introduce in future workshops, where we are having more time for it. This time we stick to [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).


## The Workshop

The workshop is separated into several steps.
